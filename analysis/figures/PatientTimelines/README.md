**DATA**

I used the sample data given to me by the Boeckh lab to calculate the timepoint, in days, of each sample during the course of the infection. Day 0 was calculated as the first flu-positive nasal wash. I excluded the timepoints at which bronchoalveolar lavage samples were taken, because they were not used in our subsequent analysis.

**ANALYSIS**

I plotted timelines for each patient.
